## Logger

### Advantages

Flexibility and Features: External logging packages often provide a wide range of features and customization options, such as log level filtering, different output formats, log rotation, and more. These packages are frequently well-maintained and offer comprehensive functionality.

Centralized Configuration: With an external logging package, you can have a centralized configuration for logging behavior across the entire application. This can simplify the process of managing and modifying logging settings.

Community Support: Popular logging packages have a large community and ecosystem. This means you can find extensive documentation, examples, and community support if you encounter any issues or need help with specific logging scenarios.

###  Downsides

Learning Curve: Incorporating an external package may introduce a learning curve for developers who are unfamiliar with the package. It may take some time to understand and utilize all the features and functionalities offered by the package effectively.

Dependency Management: Adding an external package introduces additional dependencies to your project. This requires managing and updating these dependencies, which can increase complexity, especially in larger applications.

Integration Challenges: Depending on the design and architecture of your application, integrating an external logging package may require some adjustments or modifications to your existing codebase.

### Pros of using a local logger within each struct

Encapsulation: Each struct has its own logger instance, which encapsulates the logging behavior specific to that struct. This allows for more granular control and customization of logging within each component.

Flexibility: With local loggers, you can easily extend or modify the logging behavior within a specific struct without affecting other components. You can add additional fields, modify log levels, or change output destinations specific to that struct.

Code Organization: Keeping the logger local to each struct can help maintain clean code organization. Each struct is responsible for its own logging, making it easier to navigate and understand the logging logic within each component.

### Cons of using a local logger within each struct

Increased Memory Consumption: Having multiple logger instances can consume additional memory compared to using a shared logger. If memory usage is a concern in your application, this approach may not be optimal.

Code Duplication: With local loggers, there may be some duplication of code for logger initialization and configuration across different components. This duplication could lead to maintenance overhead if changes to the logger setup are required.

Inconsistent Logging Behavior: With different loggers in each component, it may be more challenging to maintain consistent logging behavior across the application. Configuring log levels, formatting, or output destinations separately for each logger can introduce inconsistencies.
